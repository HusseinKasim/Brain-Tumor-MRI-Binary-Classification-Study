# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Binary-Classification-Study
My Graduation Project done at the German Jordanian University (GJU) with Dr. Samer Nofal as my supervisor.
This project conducts a study on a Brain Tumor MRI Dataset found on Kaggle () with a Machine Learning model created using PyTorch.

The dataset was split twice:
-Once with 90% training images and 10% testing images
-Once with 80% training images and 20% testing images

Each data split had 12 experiments conducted on it, for a total of 24 experiments, with varying values for:
-Batch size
-Number of epochs
-Learning rate

The results were recorded and plotted.
